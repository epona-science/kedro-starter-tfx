# The `kedro-starter-tfx` Kedro starter

## Introduction

The code in this repository demonstrates best practice when working with Kedro and TFX.

## Features

### Single configuration in `/conf/base/tfx.yml`

While Spark allows you to specify many different [configuration options](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html), this starter uses `/conf/base/tfx.yml` as a single configuration location.
